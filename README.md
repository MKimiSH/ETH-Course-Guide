# ETH Course Guide

This site is created for sharing course materials and experiences in ETH Zurich. Everyone is encouraged to contribute contents through GitHub. Visitors may also share experiences or feelings about individual courses using the comment system under each page. Hopefully all these information can help in your course selecting, learning and exam preparing.

You can find your course in the leftside list, or using the search bar.

## Contribute Your Experiences!

If you would like to contribute your content, please fork [this repository](https://github.com/Xivid/ETH-Course-Guide) on GitHub, make changes in your local repository, and send us pull requests! 

You will need a GitHub account to do so. [GitHub](https://github.com) is the most popular platform for version control and project collaboration. It works upon the famous version control system [git](https://git-scm.com). If you are not familiar with git commands, we encourage using the web interface or desktop client of GitHub. Please check the GitHub documentation about the basic operations.

To contribute your content for a course, simply modify the Markdown (.md) file of that course, located in `[department]/[course-name].md`. You can use GitHub's online editor to do so, and learning some basic Markdown syntax is strongly encouraged. If the course is not yet existent on this website, please create the Markdown file using the course's full name, put it in the directory of the department corresponding to the professor, and link it by adding an entry in `SUMMARY.md`; for example, for Algorithms Lab in the Department of Computer Science, create a file `algorithms-lab.md` in `d-infk/`, and add one line in `SUMMARY.md` at the root folder:

```pre
    * [Algorithms Lab](d-infk/algorithms-lab.md)
```

## Rules

We encourage contributing contents of the following forms:

- Course take-or-not suggestions
- Publicly available e-textbooks
- Self-composed answers for assignments and past exam papers

Contents such as the following are inappropriate for uploading:

- Pirated/paid copies of books
